# IronicEphemera


Telos has  come to the realisation that the material holding together their consciousness is slowly degrading. In the wake of their atrophy, they have begun to construct a museum of objects whose collection is steadily growing. These artefacts of 'ironic ephemera' explore upon early human technologies as Telos comes to reflect upon their memories.

Ironic Ephemera will grow with regular expansions, behind the scenes, and easter eggs throughout the duration of the residency.
